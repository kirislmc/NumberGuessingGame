# BeatTheAi - A Python Guessing Game 

This is a simple number-guessing game I built while learning Python. It challenges the player to guess the same number as the AI.

##  Learning Journey
I created this project as a **Python student** to practice core programming concepts. I've been following the [**BroCode**](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez) Python course.

##  Concepts Applied
In this project, I successfully implemented:
* **Loops:** Using `while` loops to keep the game running until the player decides to quit.
* **Input Validation:** Ensuring the player only enters numbers between 1 and 10 using a nested `while` loop and logical operators.
* **User Experience:** Implementing `.lower()` and `.upper()` to handle user inputs flexibly (e.g., 'y' vs 'Y').
* **Logical Operators:** Using `or`, `and`, and `not` to control game flow and validate conditions.
